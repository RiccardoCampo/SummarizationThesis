Judge Samuel A Alito Jr , who heard several hundreds cases over 15 years on US Court of Appeals , dissented slightly more often than typical appeals court judge , with his dissenting opinions almost always more conservative than majority 's ; his dissents in more than 60 cases often took issue with decisions siding with criminal defendants , prisoners and immigrants ; his dissents frequently voted in favor of government and corporations , deferring to what he calls good faith judgments of police officers , prosecutors , prison wardens , trial judges and juries ; he appears particularly reluctant to order new trials over what he calls harmless errors in presentation of evidence or in jury instructions ; Alito , who was appointed to appeals court by first Pres Bush , dissented in 26 cases in which both other judges were also appointed by Republicans , and in 4 cases in which both were appointed by Democrats ( M ).
